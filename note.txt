Changes made - 
if patient already admitted currently
don't allow same patient entry in admit
and show error message too

get_result cant be run twice on same variable

admit.php
// had to take in inside this ajax call as otherwise ... this second ajax call was being made .. before complete executiion of the first (outer one)
// which would lead to fetch the admit id from #admit_store before it got its value from first ajax code.
